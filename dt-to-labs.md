# Rehost on-premises DevTest environment on Azure VMs

This article demonstrates how the fictional company Contoso rehosts their DevTest environment for two applications running on VMware VMs, by migrating to Azure VMs.

The [SmartHotel360](https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360) and [OSTICKET](https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket) apps used in this example are open source.  You can download them from your own testing purposes.

## Business drivers

The Development Leadership team has outlined what they want to achieve with this migration:

- Quickly provision development and test environments. It should take minutes not months to build the infrastructure a developer needs to write or test software.
- Empower developers with access to DevOps tools and self service environments. IT will no longer be responsible for provisioning DevTest systems.
- Ensure governance and compliance in DevTest environments.
- Save costs by moving all DevTest environments out of their data center, and no longer purchase hardware to develop software.

> ![NOTE]
> Contoso will leverage the Pay-As-You-Go [Dev/Test subscription offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0023p/) for their environments. Each active Visual Studio subscriber on their team can use the Microsoft software included with their subscription on Azure Virtual Machines for DevTest at no extra charge. Contoso will just pay the Linux rate for VMs they run, even VMs with SQL Server, SharePoint Server, or other software that is normally billed at a higher rate. 

## Migration goals

The Contoso development team has pinned down goals for this migration. These goals are used to determine the best migration method:

- Contoso wants to quickly move out of their on-premises DevTest environments.
- After migration, Contoso's DevTest environment in Azure should have enhanced capabilities over the current system in VMware.
- The operations model will move from IT provisioned to DevOps and with self-service provisioning.

## Solution design

After pinning down goals and requirements, Contoso designs and reviews a deployment solution, and identifies the migration process, including the Azure services that Contoso will use for the migration.

### Current app

- The DevTest VMs for the two applications are running on VMs (**WEBVMDEV**,  **SQLVMDEV**, **OSTICKETWEBDEV**, **OSTICKETMYSQLDEV**). These VMs are used for development prior to code being promoted to the production VMs.
- The VMs are located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com** (version 6.5).
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**), running on a VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises data center (contoso-datacenter), with an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**).

### Proposed architecture

- Since the VMs are used for DevTest, in Azure they will reside in the development resource group ContosoDevRG.
- The VMs will be migrated to the primary Azure region (East US 2) and placed in the development virtual network (VNET-DEV-EUS2).
- The web front-end VMs will reside in the front-end subnet (DEV-FE-EUS2) in the development network.
- The database VM will reside in the database subnet (DEV-DB-EUS2) in the development network.
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso data-center will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

### Database considerations

To support ongoing development Contoso has decided to continue use of the existing VMs, migrated to Azure.  In the future, Contoso will pursue the use of PaaS services such as [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/) and [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/).

- Database VMs will be migrated as is without changes.
- With the use of the Azure Dev/Test subscription offer, the Windows and SQL Servers will not incur licensing fees which will keep the compute costs to a minimum.
- In the future, Contoso will look to integrate their development with PaaS Services.

### Solution review

Contoso evaluates the proposed design by putting together a pros and cons list.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

**Consideration** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Pros** | All of the development VMs will be moved to Azure without changes, making the migration simple.<br/><br/> Since Contoso is using a lift and shift approach for both sets of VMs, no special configuration or migration tools are needed for the app database.<br/><br/> Contoso can take advantage of their investment in the Dev/Test subscription to save on licensing fees.<br/><br/> Contoso will retain full control of the app VMs in Azure.<br/><br/>Developers will be provided with rights to the subscription which empowers them to create new resources without waiting for IT to respond to their requests
**Cons** | The migration will only move their VMs, not yet making a move to using PaaS Services in their development. This means that Contoso will need have to start supporting the operations of their VMs including security patches. This was maintained by IT in the past, so they will need to find a solution to this new operational task.<br/><br/> The cloud based solution, which empowers the developers, doesn't have safe guards for over provision of systems. Developers will be able to instantly provision their systems, but they could create resources which cost money but are not included in the budget.

> [!NOTE]
> Contoso could address the Cons in their list by using [Azure DevTest Labs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devtest-lab/).

### Migration process

Contoso will migrate their development front-end and database to Azure VMs using the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool agentless method.

- As a first step, Contoso prepares and sets up Azure components for Azure Migrate Server Migration, and prepares the on-premises VMware infrastructure.
- They already have the [Azure infrastructure](./contoso-migration-infrastructure.md) in place, so Contoso just needs to configure the replication of the VMs through the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool.
- With everything prepared, Contoso can start replicating the VMs.
- After replication is enabled and working, Contoso will migrate the VMs by testing the migration and if successful, failing it over to Azure.
- Once the development VMs are up and running in Azure, they will reconfigure their development workstations to point at the VMs now running in Azure.

### Azure services

**Service** | **Description** | **Cost**
--- | --- | ---
[Azure Migrate Server Migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/dt-to-iaas) | The service orchestrates and manages migration of your on-premises apps and workloads, and AWS/GCP VM instances. | During replication to Azure, Azure Storage charges are incurred. Azure VMs are created, and incur charges, when the migration occurs and the VMs are running in Azure. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-migrate) about charges and pricing.

## Prerequisites

Here's what Contoso needs to run this scenario.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

**Requirements** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Azure Dev/Test subscription** | Contoso creates a [DevTest subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0023p/) to take advantage of up to 80% reduction in costs.<br/><br/> If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).<br/><br/> If you create a free account, you're the administrator of your subscription and can perform all actions.<br/><br/> If you use an existing subscription and you're not the administrator, you need to work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions.<br/><br/> If you need more granular permissions, review [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control).
**Azure infrastructure** | [Learn how](./contoso-migration-infrastructure.md) Contoso set up an Azure infrastructure.<br/><br/> Learn more about specific [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/dt-to-iaas#prerequisites) requirements for Azure Migrate Server Migration.
**On-premises servers** | On-premises vCenter Servers should be running version 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 or 6.7<br/><br/> ESXi hosts should run version 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 or 6.7<br/><br/> One or more VMware VMs should be running on the ESXi host.

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso admins will run the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 1: Prepare Azure for Azure Migrate Server Migration.** They add the Server Migration tool to their Azure Migrate project.
> - **Step 2: Prepare on-premises VMware for Azure Migrate Server Migration.** They prepare accounts for VM discovery, and prepare to connect to Azure VMs after migration.
> - **Step 3: Replicate VMs.** They set up replication, and start replicating VMs to Azure storage.
> - **Step 4: Migrate the VMs with Azure Migrate Server Migration.** They run a test migration to make sure everything's working, and then run a full migration to move the VMs to Azure.

## Clean up after migration

With migration complete, all development VMs are now running in Azure DevTest Labs.

Now, Contoso needs to complete these cleanup steps:

- Remove the VMs from the vCenter inventory.
- Remove all the VMs from from local backup jobs.
- Update internal documentation to show the new location, and IP addresses for the VMs.
- Review any resources that interact with the VMs, and update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.

## Review the deployment

With the app now running, Contoso now needs to fully operationalize and secure it in Azure.

### Security

The Contoso security team reviews the Azure VMs, to determine any security issues.

- To control access, the team reviews the network security groups (NSGs) for the VMs. NSGs are used to ensure that only traffic allowed to the app can reach it.
- The team also consider securing the data on the disk using Azure Disk Encryption and Key Vault.

For more information, see [Security best practices for IaaS workloads in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/iaas).

## Business continuity and disaster recovery

For business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR), Contoso takes the following actions:

- Keep data safe: Contoso backs up the data on the VMs using the Azure Backup service. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-overview).


### Licensing and cost optimization

- Contoso will ensure that all development Azure resources are created using this DevTest subscription to take advantage of the 80% savings.
- Budgets will be reviewed for all DevTest Labs and policies for the type of VMs will be put in place to ensure costs are contained and over provisioning doesn't happen mistakenly.
- Contoso will enable [Azure Cost Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) to help monitor and manage the Azure resources.

## Conclusion

In this article, Contoso moved the development VMs used for their apps by adopting Azure DevTest Labs. They also implemented Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform for remote and contract developers.
